# Pretty Selector#

This is a accessibility inspired JS / CSS solution to styling custom styled select menus.

This code plugin can be found on `https://github.com/fydo23/prettySelector`

###Setup###

This module has a hard dependency on JQuery and was developed against JQuery 1.11.1. JQuery does not come packaged in this plugin and you will need to include it in your code for it to work properly.

To setup, include the `prettySelector.min.css` and `prettySelector.min.js` in your application code. Then in the on ready function, instantiate it with ` PrettySelector.init('jq-selector');` where `'jq-selector'` is some identifier of the `select` tag you want to modernize.
